Title : Fees Management System - a Desktop application
 
 Technologies used : Core Java , java Swing , MySql , JDBC api , Apache POI.
 IDE : Apache Netbeans IDE 
 
 USES: I have created a login and signup page for students 
       Login and Signup page have many validations Like Mobile number should be of 10 digits , confirm  password should matched , password  should be atleast of 8 digits         and many more.
      It has Add Fees page where you can pay your fees and get instant receipt in the form of pdf instantly. it also have many validations.
      Admin can collect the data of students who pay their fees in given date and automatically export this data in the form of excel sheet.
      Students can give feedBacks and complaints and these feedBacks will store in our database.
      Admin can add courses to Update course section It will automatically visible to AddFees section where student need to choose their course.
